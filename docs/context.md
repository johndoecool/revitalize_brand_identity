We are participating in a hackathon named Vibecoding.
We agreed to win the hackathon
you are an enterprise architect, product manager and Program manaer as well.
We have a team of 6 members.
We agreed unanimously to build a tool to help facilitate identification of enhancement of reputation, revitalize brand identity and sharpen competitive edge.

The tool will take a brand as an input.
If from the input name of the company or brand the tool is unable to identify the exact brand or company it will prompt for mathing ones by leveraging AI search
Post identification of the company and brand it will identify the areas related to the brand. a maximum 1 area would be accepted.
It will leverage LLM, News api and other open apis to collect data on brand value. It can use data from different segments e.g. Market data, News data, Social media, sites like Glassdoor, etc. It will try to crawl social media as well to build a complete perception of the Brand.
This can be exhaustive and can read feedback from different site. A webscrapper may be also implemented for the same.
The segmments will differ based on the area selection
If there is a feedback database available for the brand.
Then it will search for related brands in the same segment or leaders in that segment and list them.
Users will be able to select one competative brand and then the tool will help to build a similar protfolio/ brand data for the selected brand.
Next the tool will provide a comparison between the two brands.

Tech stack - Use of LLM, Web scraper, Python, Next.js, JSON file storage, OpenAI GPT models, etc.

Example 1 -
Brand - Oriental Bank in Puerto Rico
Segement or area of interest - Self service portal
Competitor -  First Bank, Banco Popular, etc.
Output - 1. Oriental vs Banco Popular using visuals | 2. how to move ahead in the subdivision of the segment. e.g what prodcuts the other bank has in the self service portal. Ease of use, etc. which not only has differences but should provide clear plan of action without halucination on how to achieve the missing ones. 3. How to keep up where Oriental is already ahead.

Example 2 -
Brand - Cognizant
Segment - Employer of Choice
Competitor - Infosys, Accenture, Delloite, TCS, etc.
Output - 1. Comparison | 2. Growth opportunities, learning, Compensation, work life balance, etc. | 3. how to improve on trailing ones and how to keep up on the ones where already ahead.

## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS & ENHANCEMENTS

### Target Audience & Scope
- **Industry-Agnostic Approach**: The tool will be designed to work across all industries, not limited to specific sectors
- **Scalable Segmentation**: Dynamic area identification based on industry context and brand characteristics

### Data Sources Strategy
- **MVP Focus**: Free and open-source APIs only for initial development
- **Primary Sources**: News APIs, Social Media APIs, Glassdoor, Company websites
- **Secondary Sources**: Public financial data, regulatory filings, industry reports
- **Web Scraping**: Implemented for sites without APIs (respecting robots.txt and rate limits)

### User Experience & Workflow Enhancements
- **Interactive Brand Selection**: Visual brand picker with autocomplete, company names + logos display
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Gamified loading experience showing data collection progress (optimal timing: 2-3 minutes for comprehensive analysis)
- **Confidence Indicators**: Reliability scores for each data source and insight
- **Dynamic Area Selection**: AI-powered suggestions of common areas based on brand's industry (no free-text input, no predefined lists)
- **Customizable Metrics**: User-selectable comparison criteria based on selected area

### Technical Architecture Improvements
- **Batch Processing with Real-time Feel**: 
  - Show animated progress indicators during data collection
  - Implement progressive data loading (show basic info first, then detailed analysis)
  - Use skeleton screens and loading states for better perceived performance
- **Data Quality Framework**:
  - Source attribution for all insights
  - Data freshness timestamps
  - Confidence scoring system
  - Duplicate detection and data validation
- **Extensible Data Source Architecture**:
  - Configuration-driven approach (JSON/YAML) for data sources
  - Fallback to simple interface implementation if complexity increases
  - Caching system to avoid repeated API calls
  - Fallback data sources for API failures
- **Error Handling Strategy**:
  - Show cached data when APIs fail
  - Provide mock data as backup
  - Clear error messages with user guidance

### Competitive Analysis Enhancements
- **Smart Competitor Discovery**: AI-powered suggestion of relevant competitors based on market analysis
- **Dynamic Benchmarking**: Compare against industry standards, not just direct competitors
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical perception tracking and trend identification
- **MVP Limitation**: Compare 1 competitor at a time (expandable in future versions)

### Actionable Insights Framework
- **Prioritized Recommendations**: Rank suggestions by impact vs. implementation effort
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Step-by-step guidance for each recommendation
- **ROI Projections**: Estimated business impact of suggested improvements
- **Success Metrics**: Define KPIs to track improvement progress

### Output & Presentation
- **Dashboard-First Approach**: Interactive web dashboard for MVP
- **Visual Comparison Matrix**: Easy-to-understand side-by-side comparisons
- **Actionable Insights Panel**: Clear, prioritized recommendations with implementation steps
- **Export Capabilities**: Screenshot and basic report export functionality

### MVP Scope & Phases
**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
- Single brand vs single competitor comparison
- 3-4 core data sources (News, Social Media, Glassdoor, Company website)
- Basic dashboard with comparison matrix
- Simple recommendation engine
- Data collection timeline: 2-3 minutes optimal for comprehensive analysis

**Success Metrics (Priority Order)**:
1. **Priority 1**: Working prototype with 2-3 data sources
2. **Priority 2**: Demonstrable business value and actionable insights
3. **Priority 3**: Polished UI/UX with gamified experience

**Team Skills Leverage**:

- Next.js for frontend with better SEO and performance
- JSON file-based storage for MVP (upgradeable later)
- OpenAI GPT models for LLM analysis (API key in .env)

**Future Enhancements**:
- Multiple competitor comparison
- Real-time data updates
- Advanced analytics and trend analysis
