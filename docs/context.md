We are participating in a hackathon named Vibecoding.
We agreed to win the hackathon
you are an enterprise architect, product manager and Program manaer as well.
We have a team of 6 members.
We agreed unanimously to build a tool to help facilitate identification of enhancement of reputation, revitalize brand identity and sharpen competitive edge.

The tool will take a brand as an input.
If from the input name of the company or brand the tool is unable to identify the exact brand or company it will prompt for mathing ones by leveraging AI search
Post identification of the company and brand it will identify the areas related to the brand. a maximum 1 area would be accepted.
It will leverage LLM, News api and other open apis to collect data on brand value. It can use data from different segments e.g. Market data, News data, Social media, sites like Glassdoor, etc. It will try to crawl social media as well to build a complete perception of the Brand.
This can be exhaustive and can read feedback from different site. A webscrapper may be also implemented for the same.
The segmments will differ based on the area selection
If there is a feedback database available for the brand.
Then it will search for related brands in the same segment or leaders in that segment and list them.
Users will be able to select one competative brand and then the tool will help to build a similar protfolio/ brand data for the selected brand.
Next the tool will provide a comparison between the two brands.

Tech stack - Use of LLM, Web scraper, Python, Next.js, JSON file storage, OpenAI GPT models, etc.

Example 1 -
Brand - Oriental Bank in Puerto Rico
Segement or area of interest - Self service portal
Competitor -  First Bank, Banco Popular, etc.
Output - 1. Oriental vs Banco Popular using visuals | 2. how to move ahead in the subdivision of the segment. e.g what prodcuts the other bank has in the self service portal. Ease of use, etc. which not only has differences but should provide clear plan of action without halucination on how to achieve the missing ones. 3. How to keep up where Oriental is already ahead.

Example 2 -
Brand - Cognizant
Segment - Employer of Choice
Competitor - Infosys, Accenture, Delloite, TCS, etc.
Output - 1. Comparison | 2. Growth opportunities, learning, Compensation, work life balance, etc. | 3. how to improve on trailing ones and how to keep up on the ones where already ahead.
