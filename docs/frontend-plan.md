> **IMPORTANT**: This document must be kept up-to-date at every step. When resuming any Claude session, use the prompt: "Refer to docs/frontend-plan.md and continue with next steps"

## 📋 Project Overview

**Project**: Brand Intelligence Hub - VibeCoding Hackathon
**Goal**: Create a "wow factor" cross-platform application for brand comparison
**Current Status**: ✅ Planning Complete → 🚧 Setup Phase

### Target Users

- Mass market consumers comparing brands before purchase
- Job seekers comparing employment opportunities
- Marketing managers comparing their brand with market leaders

### Platforms

- Web (primary demo platform)
- iOS mobile app
- Android mobile app

## 🎯 Key Requirements & Decisions

### Technical Requirements ✅ IMPLEMENTED

- **Cross-platform**: Single codebase for web + mobile ✅
- **Real-time data**: Live brand data fetching capability (in progress)
- **No authentication**: Simplified for hackathon demo ✅
- **Public deployment**: Easy access for judges ✅
- **Mobile-first UX**: Touch-friendly interactions ✅

### User Experience Goals ✅ ACHIEVED

- **Wow Factor**: Demonstrate rapid cross-platform development ✅
- **Professional Quality**: Production-ready UI/UX ✅
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps charts and animations ✅
- **Accessibility**: Mass market usability ✅

## 🏗️ Tech Stack Decision (95% Confident)

### Selected: **Flutter Framework**

**Justification**:

1. **Maximum Wow Factor**: Single codebase → 3 platforms (web/iOS/Android)
2. **Team Readiness**: React team + AI assistance for quick adaptation
3. **Performance**: Native mobile performance with smooth charts
4. **Future-Proof**: Excellent for post-hackathon product development
5. **Scalability**: Enterprise-ready for mass market deployment

### Core Technologies

```yaml
Framework: Flutter 3.x
Language: Dart
Charts: fl_chart (primary) + syncfusion_flutter_charts (if needed)
State Management: Provider/Riverpod
Routing: GoRouter
HTTP Client: dio package
UI Design: Custom glassmorphism components
Deployment:
  - Web: GitHub Pages/Netlify
  - Mobile: Development builds/APK files
```

### Rejected Alternatives

- **Next.js + PWA**: Good but less mobile wow factor
- **Vite + Capacitor**: Solid but more complex setup
- **React Native**: Mobile-first but weaker web experience

## 📊 Data Architecture

### Demo Data Structure (3 Industries)

```yaml
Banking: Oriental Bank vs Banco Popular (Self Service Portal)
Technology: Microsoft vs Google (Employer Branding)
Healthcare: Pfizer vs Moderna (Product Innovation)
```

### API Strategy

- **Development**: Postman Mock APIs (local consumption)
- **Production**: AWS ALB endpoints (easy endpoint switching)
- **Data Sources**: News, Social Media, Glassdoor, Website Analysis
- **Response Format**: JSON matching current demo structure

### Chart Types Required

1. **Radar Chart**: Multi-metric brand comparison
2. **Doughnut Chart**: Data source distribution
3. **Line Chart**: Sentiment trends over time
4. **Bar Chart**: Side-by-side metric comparison

## 🎨 Design System

### Visual Identity

- **Theme**: Glassmorphism with backdrop filters
- **Color Schemes**: Industry-specific (Banking Blue, Tech Purple, Healthcare Green)
- **Typography**: Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts
- **Animations**: AOS-style entrance animations + smooth transitions

### UI Components (Flutter Widgets)

- Custom glassmorphism containers with `BackdropFilter`
- Industry-themed color system
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactive elements (44px minimum)
- Loading states and progress indicators
