### iOS Build Script (`build_ios.sh`)
- ✅ Cleans previous builds
- ✅ Gets Flutter dependencies
- ✅ Installs iOS dependencies via CocoaPods
- ✅ Builds release iOS app (no code signing)
- ✅ Creates `dist/ios/` directory with app bundle and IPA
- ✅ Shows installation options for simulator and device

**Output Files:**
- `BrandIntelligenceHub.app` (For iOS Simulator or Xcode installation)
- `BrandIntelligenceHub.ipa` (For TestFlight or enterprise distribution)
