# Android Build Configuration Status

## ✅ Successfully Completed
1. **JDK 24 Installation**: ✅ Installed via Homebrew
2. **Android SDK**: ✅ Installed via `android-commandlinetools`
3. **SDK Components**: ✅ Platform-tools, Android 34, Build-tools 34.0.0

## ⚠️ Current Issue
**Java/Gradle Compatibility**: JDK 24 (class file version 68) is too new for the current Gradle/Android setup.

## 🔧 Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Install JDK 17 (Recommended)
```bash
# Run in terminal with admin access:
brew install --cask temurin17

# Set JAVA_HOME to JDK 17:
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home
export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools

# Build Android APK:
flutter build apk --release
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Java 11
```bash
# Revert to Java 11 that was already working:
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-8.jdk/Contents/Home
export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools

# May need to downgrade Gradle to 7.5 if compatibility issues persist
```
