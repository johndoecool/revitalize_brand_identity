# Brand Intelligence Hub - Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests for the Brand Intelligence Hub platform, specifically testing the end-to-end workflow across all three microservices.

## Test Structure

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # Test dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_consumer.py     # End-to-end integration test
```

## Prerequisites

1. **All Services Running**: Ensure all three services are running:
   ```bash
   ./start_all_services.sh
   ```

2. **Test Dependencies**: Install test requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Tests

### Quick Health Check
Test if all services are running and healthy:
```bash
cd tests/integration
python test_consumer.py --test-type health
```

### Full Integration Test
Run complete end-to-end workflow test:
```bash
cd tests/integration
python test_consumer.py --test-type full
```

## Test Coverage

### Integration Test Consumer (`test_consumer.py`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services Not Running**
   ```
   [ERROR] ‚ùå brand-service: Connection refused
   Solution: ./start_all_services.sh
   ```

2. **API Timeout**
   ```
   [ERROR] Request timeout after 5 seconds
   Solution: Check service logs in /logs/ directory
   ```

3. **Job Monitoring Timeout**
   ```
   [WARN] ‚è∞ Data collection monitoring timed out after 300 seconds
   Solution: Check data collection service logs, increase timeout if needed
   ```

### Debugging

1. **Check Service Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/brand-service.log
   tail -f logs/data-collection.log  
   tail -f logs/analysis-engine.log
   ```

2. **Manual API Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test service health
   curl http://localhost:8001/health
   curl http://localhost:8002/health
   curl http://localhost:8003/health
   
   # View API docs
   open http://localhost:8002/docs
   open http://localhost:8003/docs
   ```

3. **Service Status**:
   ```bash
   ./start_all_services.sh status
   ```

## Test Development

To add new integration tests:

1. Create new test files in `tests/integration/`
2. Follow the same pattern as `test_consumer.py`
3. Use minimal dependencies (avoid external packages when possible)
4. Include proper error handling and timeout management
5. Add comprehensive logging for debugging

## CI/CD Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# In CI pipeline
./start_all_services.sh
python tests/integration/test_consumer.py --test-type health
python tests/integration/test_consumer.py --test-type full
./start_all_services.sh stop
```
